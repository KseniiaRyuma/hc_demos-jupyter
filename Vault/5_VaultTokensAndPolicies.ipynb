    "# Vault Tokens And Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will guide you through creating and using Vault tokens and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an admin policy, token role, and token suitable for use by Vault administrators and revoke your initial root token.\n",
    "* Learn how to create and renew renewable tokens.\n",
    "* Use simple Vault policies that allow users configured with the [Userpass](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/userpass/) authentication method to manage their own secrets stored in the [KVv2](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2/) secrets engine.\n",
    "* Use a Vault policy with a policy segment wildcard that allows a user administrator to change passwords and policies for all users.\n",
    "* Use [Templated Policies](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies/#templated-policies) instead of creating a new policy for each new user.\n",
    "* Use policy [parameter constraints](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies/#parameter-constraints) to protect AWS keys from being exposed.\n",
    "* Learn how to use Policies with Vault Enterprise [Namespaces](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/namespaces)."
